# Vaquita

*In development, experimental*

Vaquita is a configuration management library for Go inspired by [archaius](https://github.com/Netflix/archaius).

Property values are resolved in a hierarchy of configurations polled from different sources (files, Dbs, ZooKeeper, etc.) and updated during runtime.
